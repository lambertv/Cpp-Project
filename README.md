Little project to use C++ on a program with multiple files and classes.
Will continue to add features to "game" until I feel comfortable
with the language. Good design is not a focus, though I'll try to do as
good a job as possible.

Now that I have a handle on C++ syntax, and have attempted and failed
to use pointers, and have started to despise file I/O, I'm going to
attempt to actally focus on a better design.

I still have no experience with how to structure larger programs,
but I've already learned a lot and putting some ideas on paper
might help the process along.
